# STASoftDevCourse
Pretty straight forward repo. Just a place to put all of my projects from my STA Software Development Course.

Currently having troubles with commiting full cpp project files from Visual Studio 2019, so just the project files will be found here. 
If you wish to use the files you will need to download your desired files and load them into your own created cpp project.
